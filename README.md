**Completed Portfolio Tasks (Total 40 marks for consideration out of 30- inclusive of Github Repository Structure):**

- Linear Regression Portfolio Task- Student Grade Predictor (5 Marks)

- K-Means Testing (Unsupervised Learning- Clustering) Portfolio Task (5 Marks)

- K-NN Testing (K-Nearest Neighbour) Portfolio Task (5 Marks):
  #### K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm. It operates on the principle of similarity: it classifies or predicts based on the majority class of the 'k' closest data points in the feature space. Each data point is assigned a label based on the consensus of its neighbors. K-NN is versatile and used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks. Its simplicity makes it easy to understand and implement. However, its performance can be sensitive to the choice of 'k' and the distance metric used. K-NN is particularly useful when data is non-linear and lacks a clear underlying pattern.
